      <h3>What about privacy?</h3>
      <p>Yes, your location is sent to the internet (via https) but your
location is never stored long term on the server. <del>Currently
it's completely discarded 4 hours after the last location update was received
from your device.</del> (Automated clean-up needs to be reimplemented)</p>
      <h3>Will there be an App?</h3>
      <p>Maybe, ... the API already exists.</p>
      <h3>Notes for location access by websites on Android (Chrome, Firefox) and maybe also iOS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your screen must be active</li>
        <li>The browser tab needs to be in the foreground</li>
